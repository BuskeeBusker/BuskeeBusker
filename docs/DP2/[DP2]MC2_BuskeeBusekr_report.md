## 1. POV
A buskee who incidentally became a fan of a busker by watching the busker’s busking by chance. The buskee wishes the information on busker and its songs easily accessbile at anytime. Though the buskee has enjoyed the busking fully, it was difficult to remember the information about buskers and the songs and only the impression was lasting. This POV is unique and non-trivial one we extracted from our interviews. It is surprising that buskees easily forget the name of busker even if the buskee enjoyed the busker’s performance a lot.

## 4. Top HMW questions and how

From our POV, we extracted two important parts, memorizing and searching.  HMW questions should be extracted with those two important parts kept in mind. Thus, we tried to pick HMW questions that can remove or solve difficulties regarding these two parts. Also we picked HMW questions with proper scope. Which is not too broad or not too narrow, and which is problem-driven, not solution-driven. Finally, we checked our questions are mutually exclusive (and collectively Exhaustive)

### TOP 3 HMW questions
* HMW remove buskees’ burden of having to memorize the busking information (busking schedule, busker’s name, songs, etc). (Remove the bad/Question an assumption)

* HMW make detailed information of buskers easily searchable (Change a status quo).

* HMW design the ‘searching the busking information’ entertaining instead of painful even if buskees cannot find information (Go after adjectives).

## Top 3 solution ideas and how
Among 10 solution ideas for each of 3 HMW questions, we tried to pick solutions that can can effectively account our HMW questions. The applied two criterias for selecting Top 3 solutions. Firstly, we considered actual benefits that users will get from the solutions. Solutions with more benefits should be prioritized than others. Secondly, we considered our team’s ability to implement the features. Even though some solution ideas are awesome, it those solutions are almost impossible to implement, then it’s hard to make the product at the final. We considered these two criterias and picked 3 solution ideas as below.

### Top 3 solution ideas
* Provide chronological schedule of busking in various busking venues
* Sort busking events with various tags to enable buskees to find favorite buskings efficiently.

## 8. Studio Reflections
### “Likes” Feedback
1. Topic of solving problem related to busking is interesting.
2. Well organized problem as memorizing and searching problem.


### "Wishes" Feedback
1. Real-time location saving feature would help. For example, if buskees approaches busker, automatically save location and sync it with busker information.
2. Some solutions like third solution might be hard to implement . It would be hard to implement suggestion of other information to users

### Our reflection
As we investigated the needs and insights from our users we defined our problem as memorizing and searching problems related to busking events. We are happy to get positive feedbacks for our decision.
For real-time service in “Wishes” feedback, we have considered it when we first brainstormed about solutions. We agree that this feature would be really helpful to user to solve both memorizing and searching problem. So we are going to think more about if this feature really helps users and figure out if this feature is possible to implement.
For the final feedback, we also agree that it’s hard to implement suggestion algorithm in backend system. So, if we are going to implement this feature, we will first try paper prototype to test usability of the function. Then, we will make Wizard of Oz prototype to just implement relatively easy computer frontend part and mimic our backend part with human. We think it would help to lessen the burden of implementing difficult backend logic for prototypes.
