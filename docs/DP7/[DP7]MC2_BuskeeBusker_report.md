### Introduction
1. Our service BuskeeBusker is the website that helps to find buskings and related busker information. We are doing user testing to get the feedback to improve the usability of our service.
2. In this system, you can basically (1) search busking schedule with date/location and see more detailed information, (2) search busker with their genre/gender/location or other keywords, and (3) get information from your favorite busker. 
3. You will be given some specific tasks to do and also will use our service as you want. We will make an observation about how you use/ face difficulties while using our service and this observation will help us to improve our service. 
4. After the use-session, we will ask few questions to you regarding your experience of using our service.

## Usability lessons
### Usability problems
We observed user testing process from three users and derived usability issues from them. There were total 11 usability issues in the process and we analyzed them by giving critically of High, Medium and Low. We used three standard criteria, which are written below, to determine criticality.

* Criticality criteria
    * How many participants mentioned an issue? 
    * How much do other functions affected by a mentioned issue?
    * How much benefit would target user get if this issue is tackled?

Task 1: Choose a specific date or location to search for overall busking schedule and related information.
* High: On main page, it’s not possible to see the busking events of other days. (P1, P3)
* Medium: On main page, “move to current location” button is not recognizable. (P2)
* Medium: On schedule page, it’s not possible to pin the buskers on hot busker tab. (P1)
* Low: On schedule page, It’s not possible to click on the busker box in hot busker tab and get the detailed info of the busker. (P3)

Task 2: Search for favorite buskers with various tags to view their detailed information like their busking schedules or past videos.
* High: On busker info page, there is strange text “undefined” on genre information. (P2, P3)
* Medium: On buskers page, it’s not possible to check on multiple options. (P2)
* Low: On busker info page, pink facebook button doesn’t seems to have external consistency. (P2)

Task 3: Follow the favorite buskers and view the recent posts written by them to get information about their recent status.
* High: On my feed page, it’s not possible to comment on the posts. (P1, P2, P3)
* Medium: On my feed page, “Pin this Busker” seems unnecessary because buskers appear on the page are already pinned. (P2)
* Medium: On my feed page, it’s hard to know the difference between heart and star icon. (P1)
* Medium: On my page, there is no way to unpin the pinned posts. (P2)

### Plan to improve
For each tasks, we defined criticality for each usability issues with the level High, Medium and Low. As higher level of criticality means higher importance to our system, we are going to solve higher level criticality issues first. The specific plans for each usability issues are written below. 

1. Add date selector on the main page to make user select the date for map.
2. Change the color of “move to current location” button to make it more visible.
3. Implement pin busker functionality in hot busker tab.
4. Make busker box clickable and link it to detailed busker info page.
5. Delete undefined genre information stored in database and also check it on client side code.
6. Make it possible to check on multiple options. But we would consider more about this issue because it might decrease usability in some cases.
7. Change facebook icon color to blue to maintain external consistency.
8. Add comment function to busker posts to enable interaction between busker and buskee.
9. Delete “Pin this busker” option because this option is not needed in the page.
10. Delete star icon on the post because star icon has overlapping meaning with heart icon.
11. Make it possible to unpin the already pinned post.

### High-level reflections
The primary lesson we learned from user testings is that more user testing gives more chance to improve the product. So far, we have gone through many user testings in paper prototyping and mid-fi prototyping phase and got useful feedbacks. We have discussed a lot and tried hard to address issues came out from user testings. So, we are slightly confident at the user testing of DP7. However, when we actually conducted the user testing, there were still a lot of usability issues found by users. We realized that even though we have improved our product a lot, we still have to put more effort on addressing usability issues. Therefore, we learned there is no exact end for user testing. More user testing gives us a more chance to improve our product to meet users’ needs.


## Plan for iteration
### High level goals
* Address existing usability issues of our product with specific plans.
* Add tutorial for users who are not familiar with English.
* Get feedbacks and evaluations from target users.

Considering we have only one week, we defined three main goal to finalize our design process. We primarily considered two main perspectives. First, we considered product perspective. As we have collected a set of usability issues for our product in user testing, we would focus on addressing these usability issues. The specific plan to address those issues are introduced in section 3. Usability lessons.

Second, we also considered user perspective. When we conducted user testing, we found that users who are not familiar with English felt uncomfortable when using our product. So we thought that it’s necessary to add some kind of tutorial for those users. We would consider about this issue more and we would add tutorial that would help these users. The one concrete way we are thinking now is to add short Korean introduction on the start of our website.

Finally, after achieving two main goals of two perspectives, we would try to get feedbacks and evaluations from target users. As we have to evaluate our product both qualitatively and quantitatively, it would be helpful to ask target users about our final product. But the problem is that it would be tight to achieve all high level goals. So we would primarily focus on first two high level goals, and then if there is remaining time, we would finalize our product with user evaluation.

## Studio Reflections
### “Likes” Feedback
a) Qualitative question 

### “Wishes” Feedback
a) It would be better to compare with other services/possible ways for the same ‘goal’ question

b) Map interview questions with tasks

c) Add information about time in informed consent

d) I am worried how you would gather target users

### Our reflection
#### Overall reflection
Firstly, we were satisfied since there were no serious feedback on our user testing method. Moreover, feedback helped us to be more prepared to get better results from user testing. Especially, we mapped our questions to each tasks from feedback b). This helped us identify usability issue separately from each tasks.

#### Reflection to each category
a) We added a question to ask user to compare our service with existing ones such as “Indistreet”

b) We reorganized interview questions and categorized them into each tasks

c) We added the information in informed consent about expected time taken in user testing.

d) We have extensively asked many friends of ours and have enough potential users for testing
