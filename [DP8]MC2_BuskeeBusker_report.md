## 1. Iteration 
### Bugs fixed & features added: We (1) fixed bugs found in previous round of user testing and (2) added/redesigned some features.   
#### Main page
a) Changed text ‘Delete Circles’ to ‘Clear Result’ in main page to give more intuitive instruction to users. 
b) Changed the color of ‘current location’ button so that user easily recognize it. 
#### Busking (Schedule) page
a) Removed dummy pre-loaded image for each busker’s info page that confused users in previous user testing.  
b) Changed design implementation of date/location choice feature to enhance responsibility of feature.  
#### Buskers’ information page 
a) Fixed “Undefined’ at genres in each buskers information page. 
b) Changed visual representation of button for each buskers SNS (facebook, instagram) to enhance external consistency.  
#### Feed page 
a) Removed ‘star’ button that many user confused about. 
b) Redesigned ‘pin’ button and related features so that user can pin exactly what they want among post/busking event. Distinguished post with and without busking information.
 
### User testing: To reflect a studio feedback about effectiveness measurement of our system, we recruited 5 more users to compare our system with other existing methods.  
#### Method: We asked users to do followings. Each tasks assume some situation as our system uses limited database.  
#### Searching busker based on their busking date and location. 
* There was a real busking event of band ‘Salmonsushi’ in June 12nd, in Sinlim at 6pm. . 
* We asked users to assume that they saw a busker in Sinlim, Junel 12nd at 6pm and find out the name of this band using any searching method he want. (max 5mins)
* We showed them our system BuskeeBusker, ask user to find out name of busker with same information. 
#### 4 of them failed to find the busker in 5 minutes. They said that they searched the busker in google or facebook but could not find the busker. After seeing our system, they all agreed that our system dominate facebook or other SNS based busker search. 
#### Three of them wondered it would be much greater if we had real busking data for every buskers. Although we scoped out this ‘data-gathering’ process, incomplete data issue leaves much to be desired. 
 
## 2. Individual Reflections

### Hyoung seok Kim
1. I contributed to the main page UI and busker search page UI. In main page, I placed sliding images to introduce our website. Also, on the bottom of the main page, hot busking place with google map is provided. As it is hard for a user to pick small marker on the map, I devised a wide circle that can cover nearby events and show them on the right. If a user want to reset drawing, he can delete circles by clicking the button on the top right and draw the circles again. Also, a user can move the map to current location by clicking the location icon. This feature helps a user to find busking events that are nearby the user’s current location. In buskers page, I made searching functions based on firebase DB. With these functions, a user can search with various filters to find buskers in our website. For the result of the search, I devised busker info card that changes its border color when hovering to show that it’s clickable. If a user clicks on the card, then he can move to see the detailed information of the busker. These are my main contributions in this project.
2. Most of the things worked well in our project. Team communication has worked really well between us because we were all in the same club. We know each other well and able to understand each other in most situations. It’s hard to pick out a thing that hasn’t worked well. But if I have to choose one, it might be the time management. As we were all busy students and not familiar with web development, we undergo time shortage at first. However, we managed this issue by collaborating well between the teammates. When there was an issue that takes a lot of time, we actively take discussion and collaborated for that issue to manage it efficiently. I think this strategy definitely helped us to reduce the time cost at the end. In conclusion, I learned that communication and collaboration is important. For the next projects that I might take in the future, I would try to communicate well and collaborate actively with teammates.
3. From the design process and GUI implementation in the class, I could realize the value of needs finding and user testing. Before doing this project, I have done mere software implementations before looking for users. These implementations have satisfied me, they are not that useful in our world because there are no users. I learned that finding the needs of users is really important for developing software. Also, user testing is another important thing that I learned in this class. I thought that user testing is really cumbersome process because of its cost. However, now I realized that the user testing is worth its cost because it gives great chance to improve UI. I think that more user testing gives better result and I would actively conduct user testing for future projects.

### Kyung Je Jo
1. Contribution: The pages I was in charge of designing and implementing was busker’s page and mypage. As a team, we shared some image of what should be included in a page and what should not. However, organizing and displaying the shared ideas in a page was my task. Especially, in busker’s page, our team wanted to put too many information all together. I decided to categorize them into three sections: 1) information, 2) schedule, and 3) videos. Furthermore, I added more efficiency in terms of space by using buttons that explicitly seemed clickable and follow external consistency. Similarly, in mypage, I made three tabs to display informations in an organized manner.
2. Our team’s chemistry was boosted by our friendship. We knew each other for more than three years, and also experienced teamwork with the current teammates before. We could start right on from the very first day of our team meeting. Thus, we could use our time in most efficient way from the beginning of the semester. We were all thinking to make this project big, a full website with multiple pages. Therefore, time management was the biggest hurdle. For each pages, we have deep discussion of what should be included for each pages. Then, we allocated at most two pages per person to implement. I learned that having deep discussions is really important before any implementation is done. Teammates are very likely to have different picture in mind. 
3 “Users are not always optimistic about new UI.” We implemented the UI with passion and confidence that it is awesome and useful. However, there often seemed clear difference between users’ expectation versus our product. Thus, I learned that users’ feedback must be the most important part in implementing user-centered GUI. As we went through the iteration cycle of designing and getting feedback, I also learned about iteration cycle itself. Most significantly, how I should run a user testing or what questions I should be asking to users in order to receive meaningful feedback.
 
 
### Seokchan Ahn
1. I directly contributed to header design and ‘Feed’, ‘Login’ pages. Also I helped some design others. First, In ‘Feed’ page, I developed login modal, which is activated when an user has not login, post card system like facebook, pin post/busking system, and hot now/recommend banners. I tried to think efficiency, safety and explicit notification about what user did right now. Second, In ‘Login’ page, I made login form and validation/verification logic. So if user input wrong password, only password input is removed. And if user input wrong id, id and password input is removed. Also if id or password input is not satisfy with our basic rules, such as password’s length has to be longer than six character, notify that explicitty. I tried to safety for user in login process. Third, about some overall design, I tried to think about internal consistency, it means UI looks like ‘semantic UI’ in our project. Thus I helped some semantic UI design to others.
2. I worked well in my team. The basic reason was that we were in same club, MSK. Our work process was aligned. We always set what we have to do next, and always do that next time. Also we tried to distribute individual work equally, and it was done at an acceptable level for all of us. Thus I never feel some ‘hurdle’ in this team project. Based on these happy team project experience, I get some lessons to be ‘good’ team and make ‘good’ product. First, each team member should be harmonious even in outside work. I realized team project is mainly consist of a ‘human’ again. Second, each team member should be share same vision in work process and expected results. It reduces unnecessary communication and helps to keep things going. I will use these two lesson for next team project and make hurdles be broken.
3. First, I learned about importance of user testing and iteration process user-centered design. I had considered a lot of user experience and proud of my UI. However, after user testing, I realized about what I had not considered. Also it is really important things. Thus I can develop my thought about UI through iteration process. Second, I learned how to use development frameworks, such as semantic UI, in web based UI implementation. I was tried to develop some inter-company dashboard web in last summer. I made it but I didn’t understand what is html, css, and js. Since this project, however, I have some concepts about these things through studio sessions. Also I learned about some development frameworks. It should help me later. 
 
### Eun-Young Ko
1. I contributed to schedule page and busker’s info page (with Kyungje Jo). In schedule page, I implemented ‘search’, result part, and detailed information window. I implemented search function and made each buttons (information/map) can show relevant information. All of these functions uses DB stored in firebase. When I implemented the search/result part, I tried to maintain external consistency as this functions are very common in other sites. Also, when i implement right-window with buskers detailed information or map, I tried to maintain internal consistency with ‘buskers info’ page. Regarding the search page, Kyungje Jo designed the page and implemented features and I made each page for different artists can have different, busker-specific information - from DB, the busker info page should get each buskers image, name, genre, video, or upcoming busking schedules. 
2. All of our team member did great job with each other. It was great that each member has different strength (relative) and could contribute effectively. It was also great that every team member were very willingness to help each other when one is facing some specific difficulties. 
3. I could learn a lot of different skills in this implementation steps. However, I will only point out three skills that I fould really useful. First of all, I could learn about ‘binding’ in java script - when I implemented function that iterate list of elements (buttons) and define onclick function on each, the intended onclick event did not showed up for non-last elements. Hyoungseok Kim helped me to handle this issue. Second, the use of firebase DB and synchronizing it. I could learn how json data structure can be constructed and used in js. Also, when I first implemented ‘like’ button in busker’s info page, the effect of clicking like button was reflected only when I reloaded the page. Thanks to Kyungje Jo, I could learn how I can synchronize click effect without reloading the page. Third, while implementing location detailed information window in schedule page, I could experience google map API. With google map API and stored geocode for each busking location, I could draw a map with marker at specified busking location and automatically get text address for the point.
